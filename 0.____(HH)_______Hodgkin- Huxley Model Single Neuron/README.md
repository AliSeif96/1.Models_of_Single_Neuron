## Hodgkin-Huxley Model of an Inhibitory Interneuron in Rat Hippocampus.

In the 1940s, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley clarified the fundamental physical mechanism by which electrical impulses are generated by nerve cells, and travel along axons, in animals and humans. They experimented with isolated pieces of the giant axon of the squid. They summarized their conclusions in a series of publications in 1952; the last of these papers is arguably the single most influential paper ever written in neuroscience, and forms the foundation of the field of mathematical and computational neuroscience. This chapter is an introduction to the Hodgkin-Huxley model.


Hodgkin and Huxley’s formulas are
