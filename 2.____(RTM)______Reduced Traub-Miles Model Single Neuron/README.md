## Reduced Traub-Miles Model of a Pyramidal Neuron in Rat Hippocampus.

This is a slight modification of a model due to Ermentrout and Kopell, which in turn is a substantial simplification of a model of a pyramidal excitatory cell in rat hippocampus due to Traub and Miles. The functions αx and βx are
