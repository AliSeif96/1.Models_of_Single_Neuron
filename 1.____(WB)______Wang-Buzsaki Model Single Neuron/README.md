# WB
## Wang-Buzsaki Model of an Inhibitory Interneuron in Rat Hippocampus.

Wang and Buzsaki proposed a model of an inhibitory basket cell in rat hippocampus. Basket cells derive their name from the fact that the branches of their
axonal arbors form basket-like structures surrounding the cell bodies of othercells.

Two different classes of inhibitory basket cells are ubiquitous in the brain, the parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells, which contain the protein parvalbumin, and the cholecystokinin-positive (CCK+) basket cells, which contain the hormone cholecystokinin. The PV+ basket cells are called fast-firing because they are capable of sustained high-frequency firing, and are known to play a central role in the generation of gamma frequency (30–80 Hz) oscillations. It is thought that gamma rhythms are important for sensory processing, attention, and working memory. The WB model is patterned after the fast-firing PV+ basket cells.
